# DataScienceSuite
DataScienceSuite - a simple text generation AI written in Python3

## Version 1
`dataset.py` creates the *dataset.json* from the *raw_dataset.txt*
`predict.py` takes in words and generates text inspired by the dataset

## Version 2
It's exactly the same as v1 but instead of character by character, it goes word by word.
It uses the same *raw_dataset.txt* but instead uses *v2.dataset.json*
